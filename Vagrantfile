  # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration
  # options are documented and commented below. For a complete reference,
  # please see the online documentation at vagrantup.com.

  # Default Ubuntu Box
  #
  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "precise32"

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.
  config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # Forward Agent
  #
  # If true, then any SSH connections made will enable agent forwarding.
  # Default value: false
  config.ssh.forward_agent = true
  config.ssh.forward_x11 = true

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
    vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
  end
  
  # Provisioning
  #
  # Process one or more provisioning scripts depending on the existence of custom files.
  #
  # provison-pre.sh acts as a pre-hook to our default provisioning script. Anything that
  # should run before the shell commands laid out in bootstrap.sh (or your provision-custom.sh
  # file) should go in this script. If it does not exist, no extra provisioning will run.
  if File.exists?(File.join(vagrant_dir,'provision','provision-pre.sh')) then
    config.vm.provision :shell, :path => File.join( "provision", "provision-pre.sh" )
  end

  # bootstrap.sh or provision-custom.sh
  #
  # By default, our Vagrantfile is set to use the bootstrap.sh bash script located in the
  # provision directory. If it is detected that a provision-custom.sh script has been
  # created, that is run as a replacement. This is an opportunity to replace the entirety
  # of the provisioning provided by default.
  if File.exists?(File.join(vagrant_dir,'provision','provision-custom.sh')) then
    config.vm.provision :shell, :path => File.join( "provision", "provision-custom.sh" )
  else
    config.vm.provision :shell, :path => File.join( "provision", "bootstrap.sh" )
  end

  # provision-post.sh acts as a post-hook to the default provisioning. Anything that should
  # run after the shell commands laid out in bootstrap.sh or provision-custom.sh should be
  # put into this file. This provides a good opportunity to install additional packages
  # without having to replace the entire default provisioning script.
  if File.exists?(File.join(vagrant_dir,'provision','provision-post.sh')) then
    config.vm.provision :shell, :path => File.join( "provision", "provision-post.sh" )
  end
